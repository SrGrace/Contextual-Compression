Oncogenes cause cells to grow out of control. They promote cancer cell growth. Oncogenes are damaged versions of normal genes called proto-oncogenes proto-oncogenesA normal gene involved in the control of cell growth and division that can mutate (change) and become an oncogene. Mutations can be inherited or caused by exposure to a carcinogen (a substance that causes cancer) in the environment. . A gene mutation is a permanent alteration in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene, such that the sequence differs from what is found in most people. Mutations range in size; they can affect anywhere from a single DNA building block (base pair) to a large segment of a chromosome that includes multiple genes. In some cases, the mutation occurs in a person’s egg or sperm cell but is not present in any of the person’s other cells. In other cases, the mutation occurs in the fertilized egg shortly after the egg and sperm cells unite.Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often disabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Typically, changes in many genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell. Cells often die if they are damaged, through failure of a vital process or the immune system; however, sometimes damage will knock out a single cancer gene.

It is the apocalyptic story of a northern California coastal town filled with an onslaught of seemingly unexplained, arbitrary and chaotic attacks of ordinary birds-not birds of prey. The location scenes in the Alfred Hitchcock-directed film, The Birds (1963), were filmed in Bodega Bay. The town markets itself with the film in many ways, including its Birds-themed Visitors' Center. The location was also featured in the cult horror movie Puppet Master (1989). Bodega Bay has served as a location for several major films: 1  The Birds (1963) Except for a short sequence at the beginning filmed in San Francisco, most of the film's exterior scenes were filmed around the two towns of Bodega (a small inland village) and Bodega Bay (a larger village on the bay).The Birds is a 1963 horror thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, loosely based on the 1952 story  The Birds  by Daphne du Maurier. The film features the screen debut of Tippi Hedren. It also starred Rod Taylor, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette and Veronica Cartwright. The screenplay was by Evan Hunter.After filming “Shadow of A Doubt” in Santa Rosa in 1948, Alfred Hitchcock returned to Sonoma County in 1961 to find a remote coastal location for his next project “The Birds.” He chose Bodega Bay, with surrounding bleak treeless hills, quiet fishing harbor and fog. Based on a short story by Daphne DuMaurier, the original story took place in an English seashore village where murderous birds attacked the local villagers.

The Clearwing moth is a beautiful insectAlso called hawk moths, sphinx moths, clearwing moths and bee-hawk moths, and in the caterpillar stage, they are called hornworms. Hummingbird moths share a lot of common characteristics with hummingbirds, which often leads to confusion if backyard birders aren't aware that these distinct moths may be nearby. 1 Flocks: Hummingbirds are more aggressive than moths, and while some flocks may form at feeding areas, it is more common to see hummingbirds alone. 2  Hummingbird moths, however, are more likely to travel together and show no aggression toward other moths.Some people have been puzzled lately by a hummingbird-like moth in flower gardens.

A western blot is a laboratory method used to detect specific protein molecules from among a mixture of proteins. This mixture can include all of the proteins associated with a particular tissue or cell type. The first step in a western blot is to prepare the protein sample by mixing it with a detergent called sodium dodecyl sulfate, which makes the proteins unfold into linear chains and coats then with a negative charge.The immunoblot is a laboratory test that looks for antibodies the body makes against different molecules, or “antigens,” that are part of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. Western Blots were the first type of immunoblot developed for Lyme disease testing. Western blot. This is an immunoassay test method that detects specific proteins in blood or tissue. It combines an electrophoresis step with a step that transfers (blots) the separated proteins onto a membrane. Western Blotting. Western blot analysis can detect one protein in a mixture of any number of proteins while giving you information about the size of the protein. It does not matter whether the protein has been synthesized in vivo or in vitro. You will use this antibody as a probe to detect the protein of interest. Western blotting tells you how much protein has accumulated in cells. If you are interested in the rate of synthesis of a protein, Radio-Immune Precipitation (RIP) may be the best assay for you.The proteins are then transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF), where they are stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies. The name western blot was given to the technique by W. Neal Burnette and is a play on the name Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection developed earlier by Edwin Southern.A series of blood screenings are performed to test for HIV. The enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA or EIA) is the first test that your doctor will order to screen for HIV. ELISA and the Western blot test detect HIV antibodies in your blood.

Infant jaundice occurs because the baby's blood contains an excess of bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin), a yellow-colored pigment of red blood cells.In cases where pre-hepatic jaundice has been caused by an infection, such as malaria, medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes caused by elevated levels of the chemical bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). The term jaundice is derived from the French word jaune, which means yellow.Phototherapy. Phototherapy is treatment with light. It is used in some cases of newborn jaundice to lower the bilirubin levels in your baby’s blood through a process called photo-oxidation. Oxidation is the process of adding oxygen to change a substance (in this case, the bilirubin).Jaundice is not an illness in itself, but a medical condition in which too much bilirubin -- a compound produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells -- is circulating in the blood. The excess bilirubin causes the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes in the mouth to turn a yellowish color.Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes, and the whites of the eyes caused by increased amounts of bilirubin in the blood.

Permanent Residents have the right to apply for citizenship after three years of physical residency in Canada and meeting other eligibility requirements. The process to obtain a PR card, or to replace or renew it, is the same. The applicant must apply while physically present in Canada and prove entitlement to Permanent Resident status by accounting for all absences from Canada in the last five yearsA permanent resident card is the main way Canadian perment residents of all ages(formerly known as landed immigrants) prove their status to government agencies You must show your PR Card when returning to Canada after travelling internationally by any commercial carrier (i.e. plane, train, boat or bus). If you need to travel before your PR Card can be issued, you must apply for a Permanent Resident Travel Document at the nearest Canadian Diplomatic Mission (Canadian Consulate, Embassy, or High Commission). Please remember the following: 1  Have the Travel Document application filled out correctly before you leave.Note: If you are a conditional permanent resident you cannot replace your card if it is expired, or within 90 days of expiring. A conditional permanent resident whose card is expiring may apply to have the conditions on his or her permanent resident status removed.

Phytochemicals, by the strictest definition, are chemicals that are produced by plants. Currently, the term is being used only for those plant chemicals that may have health-related effects but are not considered essential nutrients (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and vitamins).The term phytochemicals is a broad name for a wide variety of compounds produced by plants. They’re found in fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, and other plants. Each phytochemical comes from a variety of different plant sources and has different proposed effects on, and benefits for, the body. Some researchers estimate there are up to 4,000 phytochemicals!The development of rapid and accurate analytical methodology and the preparation of purified analytical and experimental standards for the analysis of plant phytochemicals is a key part of the new research efforts aimed at unlocking the mode of action of phytochemicals in both plant and animal systems.We found that there are optimal levels of carbon dioxide for the production of these desirable chemicals.

Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, known to cause several diseases worldwide in cattle, including rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposthitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis. Although these symptoms are mainly non-life-threatening it is an economically important disease as infection may cause a drop in production and affect trade restrictions.

The Valley of Marvels in Babille, Ethiopia. In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide. The terms U-shaped and V-shaped are descriptive terms of geography to characterize the form of valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it.

A V-shaped valley is transformed into a U-shaped valley through the glacial erosion processes of plucking and abrasion. This results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier. A material called boulder clay is deposited on the floor of the valley. U-shaped valley in Leh valley, Ladakh, NW Indian Himalaya. The glacier visible at the head of the valley is the last remnants of the formerly much more extensive valley glacier which carved this valley.This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California.

A cycle is counted from the first day of 1 period to the first day of the next period. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens. The rise and fall of levels of hormones during the month control the menstrual cycleFor most women, the length of time between ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary) and their monthly period is between 12 to 16 days (this is called the luteal phase). The first day of your menstrual cycle is the first day of your period (day 1). The period usually then lasts anything from 3 to 7 days. You’ll probably find that if you get any period pains, they’ll be at their worst in the first few days of your period. Your periodThe menstrual cycle is an average of 28 days, although it is normal to vary between 23 and 35 days. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period. Ovulation is the release of the egg from the ovary. This usually occurs at about day 14 of the cycle. Once released, the egg is fertile for up to 48 hours. If the egg is not fertilized, then the lining of the uterus will disintegrate, causing a period. By knowing your menstrual cycle, it is possible to approximate when you will be most fertileOvulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate.

Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting. The average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older. Most bulimics go through a period of prolonged dieting or restricted eating before the cyclic binging-purging episodes begin.Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to attempts to rid oneself of the food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking a laxative. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%.Bulimia nervosa (buh-LEE-me-ah nur-VOH-suh), often called bulimia, is a type of eating disorder.

A person with bulimia may be thin, overweight, or have a normal weight. Also, bulimic behavior, such as throwing up, is often done in private because the person with bulimia feels shame or disgust.

Males are affected by eating disorders at a rate one tenth of that of females. Bulimia nervosa is a common and treatable condition that often presents in the primary care setting. The hallmark sign for bulimia nervosa is a distorted view of food and eating. Patients with this condition often maintain a normal or above-normal weight.A person with bulimia feels he or she cannot control the amount of food eaten.

Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption.Consumer Capitalism will be a critical addition to the growing debate on the consumer as citizen and consumer protection policies. The unfettered marketplace, in which uncertainty rules and the admonition caveat emptor ('let the buyer beware') dictates each consumer decision, has today virtually disappeared. Consumers have become the focus of intensive economic policymaking designed to protect them from the risks and disappointments of the market.Consumer capitalism is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which consumer demand is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through mass-marketing techniques, to the advantage of sellers. The theory is controversial. It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.It is based upon individual selfishness and not communal goals. To conclude, it is evident that global capitalism has developed a panetary consumer culture and that that culture both excludes and exploits.

Consumer capitalism is a term that has been continually redefined since its introduction into popular culture in the 1920s as the public relations industry became ubiquitous, and used techniques derived from psychology and sociology to mass market consumer goods. For instance, the consumer may think he wants or needs a product, and as long as this desire is maintained, the value of the product will continue to rise. Consumer capitalism functions on the basic economic paradigm of supply and demand, but without regard to a product's intrinsic value.It depends upon a new kind of individualism-projective individualism, where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.

Oct. 20, 2012 -- American boys are starting puberty up to two years earlier than decades ago, new data show. Boys are entering puberty at an average age of 10 among whites and Hispanics, and at an average age of 9 among African-Americans. About a third of boys start to mature sexually up to two years earlier than average. Although there is a wide range of normal ages, girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11; boys at ages 11–12. Girls usually complete puberty by ages 15–17, while boys usually complete puberty by ages 16–17.

Part of the Compliance glossary: Business sustainability, also known as corporate sustainability, is the management and coordination of environmental, social and financial demands and concerns to ensure responsible, ethical and ongoing success. The goal of sustainability requires a more extended timeline for return on investment (ROI) but once initial investments are made, they can actually lead to increased profitability.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Aldolase A is an enzyme that catalyses a reversible aldol reaction: The substrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) is broken down into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP). This reaction is a part of glycolysis.Reference Range. Aldolase is an enzyme responsible for breaking down glucose products into energy, specifically converting fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate.(redirected from Liver-type aldolase). A gene on chromosome 9q21.3-q22.2 that encodes aldolase B (fructose-bisphosphate aldolase), a glycolytic enzyme that catalyses the reversible conversion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.Aldolase is present in all animal and plant tissue, and in most microorganisms. Class I aldolase, found in animal and higher plant tissue, is characterized by the lack of requirement for a bivalent metal cofactor, and by the formation of ketimine Schiff base intermediate with the substrate dihyroxyacetone phosphate.Alteration of the shape of the enzyme makes it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers. If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose. A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells.Description. Aldolase is a cytoplasmic enzyme responsible for converting sugar into energy, specifically splitting aldol, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, into the triose phosphates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate (a reversible reaction).The ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body. Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.SUMMARY 1.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2036, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='17226705-2e81-46d9-9fd2-13e37c635384', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9ded5bbf-fbf3-4e89-9664-6db150456b07', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='f387ab2b827d1fea4d474b9c2615edc7bf35b67b5713c6c102f139eb040970ae'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='00bcb044-ab13-49c1-bb97-803eac30a2dd', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='02b6b520aebd11715659a8e6a6fffd35f79930abd9c699898b1d258084a46e2a')}, text='If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.

This molecule is made of a nitrogen base (adenine), a ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups. The word adenosine refers to the adenine plus the ribose sugar. Definition. Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP for short, is the energy currency of life. ATP is a high-energy molecule found in every cell. Its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy. ATP is found in the cytoplasm of the cell. The cytoplasm is the gel-type filler of the cell where all of the organelles of the cell hang out. This location makes sense because the ATP needs to be near all of the cell parts so that it can supply them with the energy they need for chemical and mechanical reactions.ATP or adenosine triphosphate stores and releases energy by adding or breaking off one of the phosphate molecules on its tail. When a phosphate molecule breaks off of ATP it r … eleases energy. Likewise, if an ADP (a ATP with one lose phosphate group than ATP) gains a phosphate group, energy is stored. The energy is located in the bonds between the atoms in the form of potential energy.A Closer Look: Energy and ATP. The ATP molecule can store energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond joining the terminal phosphate group to the rest of the molecule. In this form, energy can be stored at one location, then moved from one part of the cell to another, where it can be released to drive other biochemical reactions. The energy stored in ATP at one location is released from ATP when the terminal phosphate bond is broken. In this process a phosphate group is detached to yield inorganic phosphate and ADP and results in the liberation of 7.3 kcal/mol (under standard conditions)Report Abuse. The energy is stored in the tri-phosphate polymer of ATP. Each phosphate has a negative charge so the three phosphates together contain a high energy -3 charge. This energy is specifically potential energy and is due to the packing together of the electrons (the source of the negative charge) due to the close proximity of the negatively charged phosphates.

DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Ginkgo biloba is a natural herbal supplement. Ginkgo biloba may have antioxidant properties. Ginkgo biloba also slows down platelet binding in the body, which may increase bleeding risks. Ginkgo biloba is commonly used for memory improvement and dementia.It can cause some minor side effects such as stomach upset, headache, dizziness, constipation, forceful heartbeat, and allergic skin reactions. There is some concern that ginkgo leaf extract might increase the risk of liver and thyroid cancers. 1 For vertigo: dosages of 120-160 mg per day of ginkgo leaf extract, divided into two or three doses. 2  For premenstrual syndrome (PMS): 80 mg twice daily, starting on the sixteenth day of the menstrual cycle until the fifth day of the next cycle.Although ginkgo biloba is a natural product, it may still cause side effects. As with any medication or supplement, ginkgo biloba (ginkgo) can cause side effects. Although some people assume that natural products (such as ginkgo biloba) are automatically free of side effects, this is simply not the case.

The axis of rotation is an imaginary line going from the north pole to the south pole. When a planet or moon travels once around an object this is considered a revolution.

On Earth, a revolution is quite a bit longer-one year!A sphere rotating about an axis. A rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation. A three-dimensional object always rotates around an imaginary line called a rotation axis. If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the x axis, followed by a rotation around the y axis, and followed by a rotation around the z axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.A rotation is when the earth spins.It takes 24 hours to rotate fully one time. The side facing the sun is in daylight, the side facing away is in night. An interesting fact is that in order for us to experience 365 days in a year, the Earth has to rotate 366 times as it revolves around the sun in that year.

Get a personalized estimate based on your location and specific car. Estimate does not include taxes and fees. The brake rotors should be inspected when the pads are replaced, and depending on their condition, they may need resurfacing or replacement. We recommend braking gently for the first 40 to 50 miles of driving on new pads. This will allow them to adjust to the rotors and help prevent squeaking.Replace or resurface the rotor if the rotor is the problem; or. Resurface the rotor on the hub using an on-car lathe. The main advantage of cutting rotors in place is that an on-car lathe cuts the rotor in the same plane that it rotates. This virtually eliminates runout and allows the rotor to run true. Resurfacing the rotors is a quick-fix and cost-effective method to let your vehicle’s brakes function efficiently. When the brake pads are substituted for new ones, the rotors must be always measured to check if they still have adequate metal left to perform safe braking. 1 On average, the cost may vary depending on location, the mechanic/repair shop and kind of vehicle. 2  Most people pay anywhere from $250 to $375. 3  Each rotor can cost $30 to $55 each, depending on the mechanic.Four year old rotors should be OK You can also call up Pep Boys or Kragen or whatever parts store is in your area and ask them what new pads and rotors cost.

The cost incurred by an entity for borrowed funds. Interest expense is a non-operating expense shown on the income statement. It represents interest payable on any type of borrowings – bonds, loans, convertible debt or lines of credit. It is basically calculated as the interest rate times the outstanding principal amount of the debt. Interest expense on the income statement represents interest accrued during the period covered by the financial statements, and not the amount of interest actually paid over that period. DEFINITION of 'Net Interest Income'. The difference between the revenue that is generated from a bank's assets and the expenses associated with paying out its liabilities. The net interest income of some banks is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than others. This can vary according to several factors, such as the type of assets and liabilities that are held.Answers. Best Answer: An example of interest expense vs. interest paid would be when a bond sells at a rate different from it's coupon rate (i.e. it sells at a premium or a discount). Example: $1,000 10 year bond with a coupon of 5%, when the market rate for such a bond is 8%. Interest Expense. Since the net profit or loss reported on your company’s cash flow statement already accounts for the interest expenses your business paid during a given period, the amount paid will not appear as a separate line item on your company’s cash flow statement.

Best Answer: 50 - 70 psi would be a good level and 70 psi is on the verge of too much. That would be the short answer. You get more dynamic pressure when pipes reduce going into fixtures, but the water pressure stays the same. Best Answer: 50 - 70 psi would be a good level and 70 psi is on the verge of too muchIdeally, the pressure should be set between 45 and 60 pounds in most residential plumbing systems.If the pressure rises too high particularly above 80 psi, plumbing fixtures and appliances (primarily water heaters) could be damaged or leak excessively. This water pressure is often well over 100 psi, and too often over 150 psi. However, the maximum recommended pressure for a residence is 80 psi. You can easily test your water pressure with a gauge, such as the one pictured here, that screws on to a hose bibb. These are usually inexpensive (less than $10) at the home center. Water pressure is the amount of force from the water main into your home. Water pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (PSI), and normal water pressure is typically between 30 and 80 PSI. Functional flow is the volume of water flowing through your pipes and arriving at individual fixtures. This is a bell-shaped device that reduces the water pressure.

Hi Friends, In this quick video I show you how to test your home's water pressure and share how to adjust water pressure down or up at the water pressure regulator. These tips come in handy when your home's water pressure becomes too high or low. You should also test to make sure your water pressure regulator is doing its job and this is the exact procedure to do that. I hope this video helps. Normal Pressure Range. The normal range of water pressure in a residential application is between 40 psi and 80 psi. There is no specific rule about how much pressure is best for your house, since everyone's needs are different. However, anything below 40 psi will likely lead to poor performance of devices that use water. Anything higher than 80 psi could lead to damage, such as blown sprinkler heads or ruptured pipes\", start_char_idx=1344, end_char_idx=3538, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",

Ground beef that’s been defrosted in the fridge can be safely kept for an additional one to two days in the refrigerator before cooking, says the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And since you thawed the ground beef in the fridge, you can also safely refreeze it within that same timeframe, says the USDA. A Ground beef should be used within two days of purchase. Be sure to check the use by information on the package label before purchase. You can store ground beef safely in your refrigerator at 35 to 40 degrees, for one to two days. If you can't use it within that time, freeze it. All fresh ground beef should be used within two days of purchase. • If fresh beef will not be used before the expiration date, place it tightly wrapped in your freezer on the bottom shelf.

De greasing2.Parkerizing is an electrochemical process that creates a protective iron-phosphate layer on the outer surface of steel. It protects the steel from corrosion and also increases its resistance to wear. The resulting surface is irregular on a microscopic scale. It does not mean that electrodes and wires are involved at all!

The protection is in two parts. First, the iron-phosphate layer itself is protectivParkerizing is usually considered to be an improved zinc or manganese phosphating process, and not to be an improved iron phosphating process, although some use the term parkerizing as a generic term for applying phosphating (or phosphatizing) coatings that does include the iron phosphating process.

Military weapons have used Parkerizing for a long time. == Answer == Parkerized finish is a non reflective matte type finish (black). It is used on military weapons to prevent reflecting sunlight and giving away a soldiers position. It is also called a phosphate finish. It is produced by a chemical reaction with the metal itself rather than being painted on. To finish is a verb meaning that you have done something and you have completed it. The noun finish is the completion of a project, or the end line of a race.We do not recommend this finish as a primary finish due to its poor corrosion resistance and wear.

Skin cancers -- including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma -- often start as changes to your skin. They can be new growths or precancerous lesions -- changes that are not cancer but could become cancer over time. An estimated 40% to 50% of fair-skinned people who live to be 65 will develop at least one skin cancer. Learn to spot the early warning signs.Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It usually occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, most often the nose. Often this cancer appears as a raised bump that looks smooth and pearly. Another type looks like a scar and is flat and firm and may be white, yellow, or waxy. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands. Squamous cell carcinoma may also appear on areas of the skin that have been burned or exposed to chemicals or radiation. Often this cancer appears as a firm red bump.Basal Cell Carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. In most cases it appears on skin that gets a lot of sun, such as the face, scalp, neck, hands, and arms. BCC generally is a skin bump or growth that is pearly or waxy and is normally flesh colored or light pink. Actinic keratosis (AK) is the most common type of precancerous skin lesion. An AK is evidence that sun damage has occurred and that the individual is at greater risk of developing skin cancer.Bowen disease is also called squamous cell carcinoma in situ..

It is a type of skin cancer that spreads outward on the surface of the skin. By contrast, invasive squamous cell carcinomas can grow inward and spread to the interior of the body. They can be new growths or precancerous lesions -- changes that are not cancer but could become cancer over time. An estimated 40% to 50% of fair-skinned people who live to be 65 will develop at least one skin cancer. Learn to spot the early warning signs.Some of the most common types of precancerous lesions are: Acitinic Keratosis is the most common type of precancerous lesion. They usually appear in areas of the body that have been exposed to the sun. These lesions often appear as red or flesh colored scaly areas or could look similar to a wart. The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is the rarest form of skin cancer. It is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands.

The condition can be inherited or acquired. Inherited means your parents pass the gene for the condition to you. Acquired means you aren't born with the condition, but you develop it.

In general, a low platelet count occurs because: 1  The body's bone marrow doesn't make enough platelets. 2  The bone marrow makes enough platelets, but the body destroys them or uses them up. 3  The spleen holds on to too many plateletsA low platelet count is often assumed to be ITP (immune thrombocytopenia). However, there are many other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, with clinical severity ranging from trivial to life threatening. ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can only be diagnosed after all other causes of low platelets are ruled out. When thrombocytopenia is severe (a platelet count less than 20-30,000/microliter), and other obvious causes are ruled out, many doctors administer the first-line treatments for ITP: prednisone, anti-D, IVIG. A rapid response to these therapies supports the diagnosis of ITP.Many people who have large platelets also have a reduced platelet count. The platelet size can be genetic, as seen in people with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, gray platelet syndrome, and May-Hegglin anomaly.

The content then covers the factors which contribute to the infection, how it can be identified and differentiated from other conditions, how it can be prevented and, if it does occur, how it can be managed.Fever, puerperal: Fever that lasts for more than 24 hours within the first 10 days after a woman has had a baby. Puerperal fever is due to an infection, most often of the placental site within the uterus. If the infection involves the bloodstream, it constitutes puerperal sepsis. Puerperal fever has gone by a number of different names including childbirth fever, childbed fever and postpartum fever.

A urinalysis is used to diagnose urethritis. In men, the urethra is located inside the penis and transports urine and semen from the body. Abdominal pain may be a sign of an infected urethra. Women have shorter urethras than men.In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek οὐρήθρα – ourḗthrā) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the urinary meatus for the removal of fluids from the body. 1 Infection of the urethra is urethritis, said to be more common in females than males. 2  Urethritis is a common cause of dysuria (pain when urinating). 3  Related to urethritis is so called urethral syndrome. 4  Passage of kidney stones through the urethra can be painful, which can lead to urethral strictures.Urethra The male urethra is a 20-cm (aprox.) canal extending from the bladder neck to the external meatus. Its function is to serve as a conduit for the passage of urine and semenThe male urethra is not an omogeneous tubular structure but is a canal made up of different parts. In anatomy, the urethra is a tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body. The urethra has an excretory function in both genders to pass urine to the outside, and also a reproductive function in the male, as a passage for sperm.Overview. The male urethra is a narrow fibromuscular tube that conducts urine and semen from the bladder and ejaculatory ducts, respectively, to the exterior of the body (see the image below). Although the male urethra is a single structure, it is composed of a heterogeneous series of segments: prostatic, membranous, and spongy.

But what you may not have realized is that not all fibers are the same. Metamucil® is the only leading fiber supplement brand with 100% natural psyllium fiber — and that makes all the difference. Psyllium husk, a natural dietary fiber originating from plantago ovata, has been the source of both soluble and insoluble fiber in Metamucil for 80 years. Studies suggest that the psyllium in Metamucil works differently. The psyllium fiber in Metamucil forms a viscous gel that traps some bile acids (made from cholesterol) and gently removes them from your body. This gel also traps some carbohydrates and sugars, allowing them to be more slowly absorbed by the body. Psyllium is a form of fiber made from the Plantago ovata plant, specifically from the husks of the plant’s seed. It sometimes goes by the name ispaghula. It’s most commonly known as a laxative. Psyllium provides more benefits to your body than decreasing the amount of time you spend in the bathroom. Numerous studies have shown that fiber like psyllium, as part of a healthy diet, can help lower a person’s risk of heart disease. Psyllium can affect your heart by lowering blood pressure, improving lipid levels, and strengthening heart muscle.The soluble fiber found in psyllium husks can help lower cholesterol. Psyllium can help relieve both constipation and diarrhea, and is used to treat irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, and other intestinal problems. Psyllium has also been used to help regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Overview. Psyllium is a soluble fiber used primarily as a gentle bulk-forming laxative in products such as Metamucil. It comes from a shrub-like herb called Plantago ovata that grows worldwide but is most common in India.

Leggy seedlings are tall, thin and weak, but you can prevent leggy seedlings by sprouting seeds at the right temperature and by providing the right levels of light, water and fertilizer. In the plant world, tall doesn't always mean healthy; in the case of seedlings, the plants may never grow well.As you might have guessed by now, the best way to prevent leggy seedlings is to make sure they are getting enough light. If you are growing seedlings in a window, try to grow them in a south-facing window. This will give you the best light from the sun.Leggy seedlings are caused by lack of light, or by light that is too weak to meet the plant's needs. Luckily, preventing leggy seedlings is a pretty straightforward affair. To prevent leggy seedlings: 1  Be sure to place the seedlings in bright light.On the 12th day, your seedlings should be @ 4 in height and start a second set of leaves. To avoid keeping the seedlings from becoming leggy or stringy, try the DIF process used by greenhouse growers. This balanced procedure includes: Temperature should always remain constant - @70 - 74 degrees. At night, try to keep it a couple of degrees cooler if you do not use grow lights.It could be that the window you are growing your seedlings in does not provide enough light or it could be that the lights you are using as grow lights are not close enough to the seedling. Either way, the seedlings will get leggy. Advertisement.

For purposes of this post, we’ll finish by talking about some important analysis that should be done once you have established your formal salary ranges. Step 2. Calculate how much more the position is worth to a well-qualified employee. Once you have your midpoint, you can add on to that amount to come up with the high end of the salary. One fair way is to establish an overall range, typically set at 40 percent. The midpoint represents center, so the high point would be an average of 17 percent more than the midpoint. This is called width of salary. Step 3. Establish the low point. Go back to your midpoint salary range and if you are still using the 40 percent width rule, deduct 17 percent from the midpoint.

If your dogs received three rounds of vaccines as puppies (around 8 weeks, 11 weeks and 16 weeks of age), they are somewhat protected until one year of age. At that time, they need boosters. Parvo is usually a juvenile disease, affecting the young and unvaccinated.Generally, the first vaccine is given at 6-8 weeks of age and a booster is given at four-week intervals until the puppy is 16-20 weeks of age, and then again at one year of age. A puppy’s vaccination program is not complete before four months of age.Vaccine is given in two doses, 2 to 4 weeks apart, in dogs older than 12 weeks of age. Revaccination is recommended annually, but only for dogs with reasonable risk of exposure. Notes: Vaccination should be based on known geographic occurrence/prevalence and exposure risk of the individual dog.1 The canine distemper vaccine is typically given in some variation of a combination vaccine that also protects your pet from several other serious diseases, such as parvovirus infection.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1814, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",

Nematodes are microscopic, eel-like roundworms. Nematodes are found in the soil; you can scoop up a handful of soil and literally find thousands of nematodes, but you won’t be able to see them. The most troublesome species in the garden are those that live and feed within plant roots most of their lives and those that live freely in the soil and feed on plant roots. Prevent nematodes from entering your garden by using only nematode-free plants purchased from reliable nurseries. To prevent the spread of nematodes, avoid moving plants and soil from infested parts of the garden.Though they are harmless to humans, animals, plants, and healthy earthworms, beneficial nematodes aggressively pursue insects. The beneficial nematodes can be used to control a broad range of soil inhabiting insects and above ground insects in their soil inhabiting stage of life. How beneficial nematodes work: The life cycle of beneficial nematodes consists of six distinct stages: an egg stage, four juvenile stages and the adult stage.

An expert diamond cutter will ensure that light is reflected evenly throughout the stone. The cushion shape (also sometimes known as a pillow cut) was the most common diamond cut from the mid-19th century onwards. In today's market it's a rare cut and sought after by those seeking an unusual alternative to an oval shape. The cushion cut is available in square and more rectangular dimensions.The teardrop shape has a round or oval shape on half the facet pattern while the other half resembles a marquise with the sides tapering to a point. Some of the world's largest and most famous diamonds were cut in to the pear shaped brilliant cut. In the pear brilliant, as with marquise shapes and other elongated fancy shapes, there is an increased likelihood of having a bow tie.. This is a dark area in the shape of a man's bow tie that occurs when the angles of the cut are not optimum.Often called a teardrop diamond, the pear-shape diamond combines, at one end, the brilliance and facet similarities of an oval-cut diamond, and, at the other end, the strong shape of a marquise diamond. In essence, one end is rounded and the other is pointed. The pear-shape diamond weighs 67.89 carats and is a champagne color. It’s believed that the rough diamond from which it was cut weighed an astonishing 240 carats. It was first cut into a 75-carat pear shape and then re-cut into the 67.89-carat size to improve its brilliance.The pear shape is a combination of the round and marquise brilliant cuts and usually has the 58 facet brilliant pattern, but can be cut with different numbers of pavilion mains of 8, 7, 6, or 4 facets.

A diamond cut is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for polishing such as the brilliant cut. Cut does not refer to shape (pear, oval), but the symmetry, proportioning and polish of a diamond. The cut of a diamond greatly affects a diamond's brilliance; this means if it is cut poorly, it will be less luminous.Most people prefer a pear-shaped diamond to have a length to width ratio of approximately 1.65:1. More elongated pear-shapes extend to a ratio of 1.80:1, whereas a more compact look is achieved with a ratio closer to 1.20:1. Emerald cuts are sleek and elegant. The Emerald cut is rectangular with cut corners. The Pear cut is a tear-drop shape and is a variation of the round brilliant cut diamond. This attractive diamond is also extremely well-suited to pendants and earrings. Many of the largest stones ever discovered have been cut and faceted into magnificent pear-shapes.Diamonds are cut in many different and exciting shapes. The shape of a diamond is often confused with its cut. Shape refers to the basic form of the diamond: round, emerald, oval or pear shaped, for example.

It is a rare transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844, and named it after Ruthenia, the Latin word for Rus' . Ruthenium usually occurs as a minor component of platinum ores; annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used for wear-resistant electrical contacts and the production of thick-film resistors. A minor application of ruthenium is its use in some platinum alloys, and as a catalyst.Platinum belongs to the family of metals like ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, and iridium. Platinum dates back its origin to the Egyptian tombs in 1200 BC. The Egyptians during this time imported the metal platinum from Nubia. It is one of the most expensive metals in the world which is very dense, soft, shiny, malleable, and ductile.

Spraying WD-40 is a popular way to remove any sticky residue.It is also called duck tape, riggers' tape, hurricane tape, or 100-mph tape —a name that comes from the use of a specific variety of duct tape that was supposed to withstand up to 100 mph (160 km/h; 87 kn) winds. Duct tape, in its guise as racer's tape, race tape or 100 mile an hour tape has been used in motorsports for more than 40 years to repair fiberglass bodywork (among other uses). Racer's tape comes in a wide range of colors to help match it to common paint colors.In 1923, Richard Gurley Drew working for 3M invented masking tape, a paper-based tape with a mildly sticky adhesive. In 1925 this became the Scotch brand masking tape. In 1930, Drew developed a transparent tape based on cellophane, called Scotch Tape.

La Superba is a semiregular variable star, varying by about a magnitude over a roughly 160-day cycle, but with slower variation over a larger range. Periods of 194 and 186 days have been suggested, with a resonance between the periods. La Superba is most likely in the final stages of fusing its remaining secondary fuel (helium) into carbon and shedding its mass at the rate of about a million times that of the Sun's solar wind.Astronomers gauge the “redness” of a star by measuring its magnitude contrast through a blue and visible (green peaking) filters. This is what is known as its B-V index, and the higher the value, the redder the star. La Superba has a B-V value of +2.5. For contrast, the familiar orange-red stars Antares and Betelgeuse have a B-V value of +1.83 & +1.85, respectively.

Explanation: Y Canum Venaticorum (Y CVn) is a very rare star in planet Earth's night sky. It's also very red, exhibiting such a remarkable spectrum of light, 19th century astronomer Angelo Secchi dubbed it La Superba.It is similar to the Sun in terms of age, mass and stage of evolution, and it has been called a solar analogue or solar twin. La Superba – Y Canum Venaticorum (Gamma Canum Venaticorum, Y CVn). La Superba is a well known star in Canes Venatici and one of the reddest stars in the sky. It was named La Superba by 19th century Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi because of its striking appearance. The star is believed to be in the last stages of fusing its secondary fuel, helium, into carbon. La Superba (Y CVn, Y Canum Venaticorum) is a variable star in the constellation Canes Venatici, well known for its strikingly red appearance.

Reflexes test neural function. Reflexes may be depressed or exaggerated. When nerve dysfunction exists, the size of the reflex response helps to indentify where the dysfunction originates. These tests help gauge the strength in your leg muscles. They can also help the physician tell if there is nerve damage as the result of a degenerative spinal abnormality. For the reflex test, the physician will gently strike the knee and the back of the heel with a small rubber hammer.All rights reserved. 1  nervous system: The Nervous System and Reflexes-The Nervous System and Reflexes In general, nerve function is dependent on both sensory and motor ... Commonly, the reflex arc includes one or more connector neurons that exert a modulating effect, allowing varying degrees of response, e.g., according to whether the stimulation is strong, weak, or prolonged. Reflex arcs are often linked with other arcs by nerve fibers in the spinal cord.The normal response is a ‘knee jerk’. This is an example of a reflex, which is an involuntary muscular response elicited by the rubber hammer tapping the associated tendon. When reflex responses are absent this could be a clue that the spinal cord, nerve root, peripheral nerve, or muscle has been damaged. When reflex response is abnormal, it may be due to the disruption of the sensory (feeling) or motor (movement) nerves or both. To determine where the neural problem may be, the physician tests reflexes in different parts of the body. See the following examples in the chart below.Check the deep tendon reflexes using impulses from a reflex hammer to stretch the muscle and tendon. The limbs should be in a relaxed and symmetric position, since these factors can influence reflex amplitude. A reflex action, differently known as a reflex, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus. Scientific use of the term reflex refers to a behavior that is mediated via the reflex arc; this does not apply to casual uses of the term reflex.Reflexes are little movements of the muscle when the tendon is tapped. A reflex can be decreased or absent if there is a problem with the nerve supply. To test your reflexes, your doctor will use a rubber hammer to tap firmly on the tendon.

Scientific use of the term reflex refers to a behavior that is mediated via the reflex arc; this does not apply to casual uses of the term reflex.Reflexes are little movements of the muscle when the tendon is tapped. A reflex can be decreased or absent if there is a problem with the nerve supply. To test your reflexes, your doctor will use a rubber hammer to tap firmly on the tendon. Just as your muscles receive signals through certain nerves, other nerves carry signals back to your spinal cord from specific sections of your skin and other tissues. Testing your sense of feeling helps your doctor find out what nerve root may be compressed. Your sense of feeling may be tested in several ways.More on nervous system The Nervous System and Reflexes from Infoplease: 1  nervous system: The Nervous System and Reflexes-The Nervous System and Reflexes In general, nerve function is dependent on both sensory and motor ...

An archetype can be: 1  a statement, pattern of behavior, or prototype which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate; In the seventeenth century, Sir Thomas Browne and Francis Bacon both employ the word 'archetype' in their writings; Browne in The Garden of Cyrus (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.Whether the archetype (the original pattern or model) is a tree, animal or a specific characteristic inherent within the collective human psyche (patience, courage, etc.), the core message is clear: The Celtic meaning of symbolic archetypes gives us a foothold on the kind of vision we have for ourselves and our lives.

Examples of archetypal characters are the femme fatale, the trickster, the great mother and father, and the dying god. There are archetypal stories as well. Other archetypal myths serve to instruct. For example, the quest archetype is typically a journey where the hero or heroine must overcome their own faults and weaknesses in order to reemerge as a mature, productive member of their society.Being unconscious, the existence of archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by examining behavior, images, art, myths, religions, or dreams. Carl Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from the collective unconscious and are the psychic counterpart of instinct. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or merely four or five forms of a single archetype.Medical Definition of ARCHETYPE. 1. a: a primitive generalized plan of structure deduced from the characters of a natural group of plants or animals and assumed to be the characteristic of the ancestor from which they are all descended b: the original ancestor of a group of plants or animals. 1. : the original pattern or model of which all things of the same type are representations or copies: prototype; also: a perfect example.\", start_char_idx=1382, end_char_idx=3583, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",

The formation of scars is caused by trauma to the skin. Under the area of trauma, healing cells called fibroblasts migrate to the site of the injury. These fibroblasts cover over the damaged area and form collagen, which is the building block of scar tissue. Normally, collagen fibers line up in a parallel fashion, forming a bridge across the wound. Image Credit: Main Image: Granulation tissue is formed at the site of an injury and is composed of rich collagen. Slowly as the injury tries to heal, this tissue fills up the space and leaves a mark or scar at the place of injury. This scar many times fades away or can be dimmed by using various scar removing or lightening creams. Click to read more below.

Best Answer: If you want to plant in hills, the hills should be a foot or so high and a couple of feet wide, plant 3 seeds per hill. Keep you hills about 7 or 8 ft apart. If planting in rows, keep your plants about three feet apart and three feet between rows. Spacing. Watermelon plants require a lot of space. Seeds may be planted in hills or in rows. Space watermelon plants 6 feet apart in hills. Thin to the best three plants per hill, advises the Arkansas extension service. If planting in rows, watermelon seeds or seedlings should be seven to 10 feet apartSometimes I plant them in what's left over from a compost pile after I used most of the compost. If you like growing things in neat rows, or if you want to plant a large area, grow watermelons on ridges, like the commercial growers do. Rows should be about 2 m (6 ft) apart and the plants spaced at 30 cm/a foot apart.

How to Grow Camellia-Provided by eHow. Camellias grown in humid, tropical conditions with a definite rainy season and a definite dry season. Keep a camellia watered well in a warm climate with helpful tips from a sustainable gardener in this free video on growing flowersJapanese camellias grow very slowly and can grow to be quite old. Some hundred-year-old plants may reach 25 feet high or more and as wide, but most gardeners can consider camellias to be 10-foot-tall shrubs. Many are even lower growing. Camellia sasanqua cultivars are faster growing than C. japonica. I heard camellias were difficult to grow and were slow growers, but hope there might be some out there for beginners. The plant needs to be in upright form. My color preference goes with white, pink, then red, because my house is a red one. I believe that the Kanjiro camellia is supposed to be relatively fast growing for camellias (in general, camellias are slow growers). Like Bookmark November 9, 2004 at 3:59PM. Thank you for reporting this comment.1 Japonica camellias (Camellia japonica) bloom in winter or early spring. 2  They have large leaves and flowers and are the species most familiar to home gardeners. 3  Sasanqua camellias (Camellia sasanqua) have smaller, darker leaves along with smaller blossoms, and they bloom in the fall. Planting Tips. 1  Camellias need to be planted a little high, so that the top of the root ball is level with the surface of the soil. 2  This helps water drain away from the trunk. 3  Camellia roots are shallow, so avoid planting them under shallow-rooted shade trees such as birch and maple.Camellia shrubs have several different growth habits and sizes.

This form of alkalosis occurs when there is a significant decline of chloride in your body, often due to prolonged vomiting or sweating. Chloride is an important chemical needed to maintain balance in bodily fluids, and is an essential part of your body’s digestive fluids.Alkalosis is a condition in which the body fluids have excess base (alkali).

Metabolic alkalosis is a primary increase in serum bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) concentration. This occurs as a consequence of a loss of H + from the body or a gain in HCO 3 - 2), which diminishes the change in pH that would otherwise occur.Normally, these two gases are kept in balance by the respiratory system. Respiratory alkalosis occurs when carbon dioxide levels drop too low. This causes the pH of the blood to rise and become too alkaline. This condition is basically the opposite of respiratory acidosis, when the blood becomes too acidic.Miscellaneous causes of metabolic alkalosis include villous adenomas, which are a rare cause of diarrhea. Villous adenomas usually lead to metabolic acidosis from loss of colonic secretions that are rich in bicarbonate, but occasionally these tumors cause metabolic alkalosis.

The condition can occur during deep dives with fatal consequences. More detailed information about the symptoms, causes, and treatments of Central nervous system oxygen toxicity is available below. There are two main types of oxygen toxicity: central nervous system (CNS) oxygen toxicity and pulmonary oxygen toxicity. CNS oxygen toxicity is usually caused by divers exposing themselves to an oxygen partial pressure of 1.6 ata or greater, and can result in convulsions, pulmonary barotrauma, and death. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is caused by divers exposing themselves to elevated partial pressures of oxygen for long periods of time, and is primarily a concern for technical divers who decompress on oxygen.Oxygen toxicity is a medical condition caused by exposure to oxygen at high pressure. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for scuba divers who dive beyond recreational depth limits, use mixed gasses such as enriched air nitrox, or use gasses with high partial pressures of oxygen for decompression stops.

Pulmonary oxygen toxicity is not of concern except in very long technical dives (extended cave or rebreather dives, for example) lasting six to 12 hours or more. Prolonged dives within the safe limits for CNS oxygen toxicity may still cause ocular toxicity, which manifests as a narrowing of the visual field and myopia.Severe cases can result in cell damage and death, with effects most often seen in the central nervous system, lungs and eyes. Oxygen toxicity is a concern for underwater divers, those on high concentrations of supplemental oxygen (particularly premature babies), and those undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The result of breathing elevated partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, an excess of oxygen in body tissues. Central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), irritability (personality changes, anxiety, confusion, etc.), and dizziness.0. Oxygen physiology for divers has been one of the most misunderstood subjects in the sport for some time. Case in point: For years, the oxygen percentage in atmospheric air was commonly taught in scuba classes to be 20 percent when it actually is 20.98 percent, rightfully rounded to 21. The hazards of CNS oxygen toxicity are easily avoided by ensuring that your dive profiles don't violate the NOAA limits.

Tweet Share Email. Symptoms similar to dementia can be seen in other illnesses. Sometimes it can be difficult to tell apart dementia from the usual mild forgetfulness seen in normal ageing. This means that the symptoms get worse over time. This is usually the case with vascular dementia too. The speed of change varies between people and also between different diseases, but in most dementias, symptoms progress slowly over several years. Everybody is unique and is affected in their own way.Here are four more surprising early signs of dementia—be sure to tell your doctor is any of these sound familiar: Your taste buds change. Big shifts in the kinds of foods you crave—especially a newfound preference for sweets—is another early warning sign, finds a Japanese study. Confusion. Someone in the early stages of dementia may often show signs of confusion. When memory, thinking, or judgment lapses, confusion arises as your loved one can no longer remember faces, find the right words, or interact with people normally. Confusion can occur for a number of reasons.Some of the causes are simpler to understand in terms of how they affect the brain and lead to dementia: 1. 1  Vascular dementia-this results from brain cell death caused by conditions such as cerebrovascular disease, for example stroke. 2  This prevents normal blood flow, depriving brain cells of oxygen. Symptoms. Vascular dementia symptoms vary, depending on the part of your brain where blood flow is impaired. Symptoms often overlap with those of other types of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease. Vascular dementia symptoms may be most clear-cut when they occur suddenly following a stroke. When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementiaApathy. A common symptom of early dementia is a listlessness or apathy. You might notice that your elderly loved one is starting to lose interest in hobbies or activities.

A firewall trusts nobody unless it is told otherwise. It secures your computer from the outside world. It helps protect computers inside a large company. A firewall gives a company tremendous control over how people use the network. A firewall examines all traffic routed between the two networks to see if it meets certain criteria. If it does, it is routed between the networks, otherwise it is stopped. A firewall filters both inbound and outbound traffic.3. My understanding of the situation is that, when the Windows firewall is off, every port on the computer (all 65535 of them) is fully open. This means that any application running on the computer can send any traffic from the computer through any port to any device on the network or the internet. If the firewall is off, every port is open and any application running on the computer can send and receive data through any port if it is designed to do so. Also any device that can connect to the computer (as a rule of thumb any device that can ping the computer) can send data through any port.In large corporations, if a firewall is not in place, thousands of computers could be vulnerable to malicious attacks. Firewalls should be placed at every connection to the internet and are also used to control outgoing web traffic as well in large organizations. Firewalls use several strategies to control traffic flowing in and out of networks. Firewalls can be configured to filter by several variables: IP address, domain name, protocol, port or even specific words or phrases.

A firewall is simply a program or hardware device that filters the information coming through the Internet connection into your private network or computer system. If an incoming packet of information is flagged by the filters, it is not allowed through. Firewalls use one or more of three methods to control traffic flowing in and out of the network: 1  Packet filtering-Packets (small chunks of data) are analyzed against a set of filters. 2  Packets that make it through the filters are sent to the requesting system and all others are discarded.Firewalls are used to protect both home and corporate networks. A typical firewall program or hardware device filters all information coming through the Internet to your network or computer system. There are several types of firewall techniques that will prevent potentially harmful information from getting through: A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a combination of both.At their most basic, firewalls work like a filter between your computer/network and the Internet. You can program what you want to get out and what you want to get in. Everything else is not allowed. There are several different methods firewalls use to filter out information, and some are used in combination.

Making the world better, one answer at a time. The Progressive Movement was an effort to cure many of the ills of American society that had developed during the great spurt of industrial growth in the last quarter of the 19th century.American progressive reform was driven by a loose-knit group of individuals who were focused on social and governmental change. They organized politically in 1912 to support the Progressive Party ticket of Theodore Roosevelt and again in 1924 to push the independent presidential candidacy of Robert LaFollette.In the 21st century, progressives continue to embrace concepts such as environmentalism and social justice. Social progressivism, the view that governmental practices ought to be adjusted as society evolves, forms the ideological basis for many American progressives.Background The Progressive Movement (1901-1917) was initiated as a response to political and corporate abuses at the turn of the Twentieth Century.The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to 1920s. The main objective of the Progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses.Progressivism in the United States is a broadly based reform movement that reached its height early in the 20th century and is generally considered to be middle class and reformist in nature.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1924, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n')]\n",

This misalignment may be constant, being present throughout the day, or it may appear sometimes and the rest of the time the eyes may be straight. It is a common condition among children. It may also occur in adults. A squint may be classified and described in different ways. For example: By the direction of the squinting (turning) eye: 1  An eye that turns inwards is called an esotropia. 2  An eye that turns outwards is called an exotropia. 3  An eye that turns upwards is called a hypertropiaLook after your eyes » Eye conditions » Squint.

It was later in its history that the dog became known as the Bandog or “ Bandogge” due, of course, to the fact that the dog did not exist under some other name like: Killer Hound, War dogs, Molossus, Mastiff, Mastyue, Villaticus, Cathenarius, Bulldogs, Dogue the Force Race and Engelsen Doguen. Description. The name Bandogge is a catch-all term for any Bulldog-type Mastiff breed. Boasting prominent muscles and a study frame, the American Bandogge Mastiff gives off an athletic and agile look. The American Bandogge Mastiff breed is thanks in most part to two American mastiff breeders. In the 1960s, veterinarian John Swinford wanted to breed the ultimate guardian dog. His efforts were the result of crossing a male American Pit Bull Terrier with a Neapolitan Mastiff female.We've put together the following Bandogge breed information and facts to create a profile of this dog so you have the critical information necessary to make a decision. Bandogge. The Bandogge, or Bandog, has a life expectancy of 10 to 12 years. Origin. Bandogge is a generic term used to describe a Bulldog-Mastiff cross. The Bandogge can represent a cross between the American Pit Bull Terrier and Neapolitan Mastiff, English Mastiff and American Pit Bull Terrier, American Bulldog and Mastiff, or Pit Bull Terrier and Bullmastiff. The popularity of the name Bandog itself was revived in the mid-1960s when a veterinarian John B. Swinford selected quality specimens of specific foundation breeds to create what he considered to be the ultimate guard dog, a breed known as the Swinford Bandog. (or Swinford Bandogge). History [edit]. The original Bandogs were bred with a functional purpose, as were all working breeds, and for the Bandog this purpose revolved around guarding and protecting. The Bandogs of old were strictly working dogs, often of various crosses and various sizes.•The term Bandog (also known as Bandogge) originated around 1250-1300 in Middle England, referring to a mastiff type dog that was bound by a chain during the daytime and was released at night to guard against intruders.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2090, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='41f255fb-70f2-4d61-a21e-7aff5ee3e89f', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='87fce1d6-2202-41cc-9620-3e9410aa1919', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='1501e5bb1452465ea8b96eeeccb95067ce7fe7a6c6c6272a90b4cfd01363bf85'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4c2d9993-d6b1-4f38-98fd-6918b484ce23', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='94ebc14dec8cd1a26ef5a92e1dfb3b8db27cdfff21a1f0cb2d1b998ae973fb9d'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='0f0088cf-9112-4204-99f1-6a49d48ad216', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='ac27575e7a8d3eca4aa7d734d2b1e9195d07fd984ed9c7fc141b0727d29ce16d')}, text=\"The popularity of the name Bandog itself was revived in the mid-1960s when a veterinarian John B.

The original Bandogs were bred with a functional purpose, as were all working breeds, and for the Bandog this purpose revolved around guarding and protecting. The Bandogs of old were strictly working dogs, often of various crosses and various sizes.Despite what some people may advertise, a Bandog is not a pure bred breed; it is a purpose bred, mixed breed working dog. The concept of the Bandog, a cross between Bull breeds and Mastiffs, is not a new. Mr. Vegas the Bandogge Mastiff at 4 years old— Mr. Vegas is my best friend. He's exactly what an American Bandogge is: loyal, obedient and protective with those guard dog instincts. He won first place in the Bully Breed class at the Bully Palooza Dog Show in March 2012.

When your voice is hoarse, it is an indication that these vibrations of the vocal folds are being hindered by mucus, swellings, obstructions or other changes in the surface of the larynx.Misuse of the voice, such as prolonged talking or shouting, is a common cause of hoarse voice. Other possible causes include tobacco use, marijuana use, and exposure to chemicals—even those found in some household cleansers—or pollutants.

Astrocytes are star shaped glial cells that perform a variety of functions in the CNS. Astrocytes provide physical support to neurons and clean up debris within the brain. They also provide neurons with some of the chemicals needed for proper functioning and help control the chemical composition of fluid surrounding neurons. In order to provide physical support for neurons astrocytes form a matrix that keep neurons in place. In addition, this matrix serves to isolate synapses. This limits the dispersion of transmitter substances released by terminal buttons; thus aiding in the smooth transmission of neural messages.List: Astrocyte Functions.

VWAP is often used as a trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution. Many pension funds, and some mutual funds, fall into this category.The weighted average cost per unit is therefore $257.78 ($116,000 ÷ 450 units.). The ending inventory valuation is $45,112 (175 units × $257.78 weighted average cost), while the cost of goods sold valuation is $70,890 (275 units × $257.78 weighted average cost).

Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is exactly what it sounds like: the average price weighted by volume. VWAP equals the dollar value of all trading periods divided by the total trading volume for the current day. The example above shows 1-minute VWAP for the first 30 minutes of trading in IBM. Dividing cumulative price-volume by cumulative volume produces a price level that is adjusted (weighted) by volume. The first VWAP value is always the typical price because volume is equal in the numerator and the denominator.Calculating Volume Weighted Average Price. Volume weighted average price, or VWAP, is the average value of a stock traded over the course of a set time horizon, which is typically one day. A trading benchmark used especially in pension plans. VWAP is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded for the day.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2174, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='ef1e3fb0-ea1f-4cc0-b766-44c6d25eec3b', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='54a4e56c-b5ad-4c68-adfa-321c3b97f1d2', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={}, hash='73a96d563e2e435b652211b3c116db361046468cd6299e0a6d187f3f5c8bf3c7'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='84258296-008e-45bb-8328-6877013a0b5f', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='dc104534e2c1eb17a3ee47860064104a34d5ec3a4565564f333f4c5930907001'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='352fecfd-8014-412a-bcd6-392d0546d2d0', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='cc0c2e4cd3da4c7cafe82d57bae1d82e21347d31fb1dfc3afc8a84b48bead682')}, text=\"VWAP equals the dollar value of all trading periods divided by the total trading volume for the current day.

For example, assume that an index contains only two stocks, one priced at $1 and one priced at $10. The $10 stock is weighted nine times higher than the $1 stock. Overall, this means that this index is composed of 90% of the $10 stocks and 10% of $1 stock.DEFINITION of 'Volume Weighted Average Price-VWAP'. A trading benchmark used especially in pension plans. VWAP is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded for the day.

The metal is heated into the austenite region of the iron-cementite phase diagram and then quenched in a salt bath or other heat extraction medium that is between temperatures of 300–375 °C (572–707 °F).Martensite is formed in carbon steels by the rapid cooling (quenching) of austenite at such a high rate that carbon atoms do not have time to diffuse out of the crystal structure in large enough quantities to form cementite (Fe 3 C). One of the differences between the two phases is that martensite has a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) crystal structure, whereas austenite has a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure.Austenitic – This is the most common type of stainless steel, accounting for up to 70% of all stainless steel production.

Almost every cell in your body is diploid containing two sets of chromosomes. So instead of 23 you have 46 chromosomes, one from each parent.

A chromosome is a singular piece of DNA, which contains many genes, regulatory elements and other nucleotide sequences. Chromosomes also contain DNA-bound proteins, which serve to package the DNA and control its functions. When you consider that there are two copies of each chromosome, and that each copy of each gene on the chromosome might be slightly different from the other, you have the possibility of two slightly different proteins being produced from them.

We have suggested that in certain organizations, culture encourages the implementation of projects. In this environment the project management structure used plays a less decisive role in the success of the projectThe structure defines the relationships among members of the project management and the relationships with the external environment. The structure defines the authority by means of a graphical illustration called an organization chart. A properly designed project organization chart is essential to project success. An important function of the organizations’ top management is to design an organization that fully supports project management. This is done by redesigning the organization to emphasize the nature of the projects and adapting how roles and responsibilities are assigned.Organizational structure is very important to an organization. An organizational structure should enable the organization to change or to respond according to its environment. If it is very effective it is called a flexible structure. Mainly there are two types of structures. They are organic structure and mechanistic structure.It is a type of organizational structure in which people with similar skills are pooled for work assignments, resulting in more than one manager (sometimes referred to as solid line and dotted line reports, in reference to traditional business organization charts). There are three primary project management organizational structures that have become the foundation for how an organization is run: functional, matrix, and pure project. Each structure has advantages, and if used correctly and in the right environment, the structure can further the completion of projects (Tait, 2010). An organizations structure can help or hurt their ability to achieve success. Some organizational structures can definitely impair the organization’s ability to deliver project success.

There are many factors can affect ATP production, one of which is temperature. When temperature increases, rate of respiration increases as well because the heat speeds up the reactions which means kinetic energy is higher. This means reactions speed up and rate of cellular respiration increases.Temperature Range. The ideal temperature range for pea respiration to occur is between 10 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit) and 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit). The rate of cellular respiration will slow down as temperature exceeds the optimal range. This is because enzymes and other cellular proteins will start to be shaken apart by the excessive energy associated with high temperatures.Best Answer: Actually they are not directly related.

As a result, the thyroid gland enlarges and excess hormones increase metabolism. However, most patients with eye symptoms have abnormal hormone levels that are accompanied by specific antibodies in the blood stream. The components of the disease affecting the thyroid gland and the eyes have common causes, but evolve separately and must each be treated separately.There are numerous symptoms of Graves’ disease—an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid gland to over-produce thyroid hormone, which is known as hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, so some Graves’ disease symptoms are the same as hyperthyroidism symptoms. However, people with Graves’ disease may also have other symptoms not related to hyperthyroidism. It can be a challenge to detect Graves’ disease early on. Eye problems that are sometimes related to Graves’ disease can be anywhere from mild to extremely severe. In more mild cases, your eyes may become red and inflamed. Or they may tear or be very sensitive to light. In severe cases, Graves’ disease can cause inflammation of the eye muscles.The symptoms that occur in thyroid eye disease include dry eyes, watery eyes, red eyes, bulging eyes, a stare, double vision, difficulty closing the eyes, and problems with vision. Research suggests that the cause of thyroid disease and thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disorder. While most people with overactive thyroid due to Graves' disease probably have some mild eye changes that do not cause them any symptoms, about three per cent of them with more severe disease will require some form of treatment.

And smokers who develop Graves' disease are more prone to eye problems than nonsmokers with the disease. No single gene causes Graves’ disease. It is thought to be triggered by both genetics and environmental factors, such as stress. Eye trouble -- usually in the form of inflamed and swollen eye muscles and tissues that can cause the eyeballs to protrude from their sockets -- is a distinguishing complication of Graves' disease.Graves' eye disease can also be present when the level of thyroid hormone in the blood is normal or low, depending on the degree of glandular stimulation caused by the immune attack and by the amount of thyroid gland destruction present at the time of diagnosis. However, most patients with eye symptoms have abnormal hormone levels that are accompanied by specific antibodies in the blood stream. The components of the disease affecting the thyroid gland and the eyes have common causes, but evolve separately and must each be treated separately.Graves’ eye disease, like Graves’ hyperthyroidism and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disorder.

The heart was reclassified as an endocrine gland when, in 1983, a hormone produced and released by the heart called atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was isolated. This hormone exerts its effect on the blood vessels, on the kidneys, the adrenal glands, and on a large number of regulatory regions in the brain.These hormones also play a role in pregnancy. Although the endocrine glands are the body's main hormone producers, some other organs not in the endocrine system — such as the brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and skin — also produce and release hormones. Once a hormone is secreted, it travels from the endocrine gland that produced it through the bloodstream to the cells designed to receive its message. These cells are called target cells. Along the way to the target cells, special proteins bind to some of thA hormone (from Greek ὁρμή, impetus) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour.

Prince wrote seven of the eight songs on the album, but Nothing Compares 2 U is the only track for which Prince takes official credit. Sinead's version is the cover. I believe that the studio version of this song is on Prince's 1st album, titled Prince (early 80s). Check it out!

Source(s): my bio class.In 2000, scientists claimed to have “resurrected” bacteria, named Lazarus bacteria, discovered in a salt crystal conventionally dated at 250 million years old. They were shocked that the bacteria’s DNA was very similar to modern bacterial DNA. This plasmid can be introduced into a bacterium by way of the process called transformation. Then, because bacteria divide rapidly, they can be used as factories to copy DNA fragments in large quantities. A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Plasmids naturally exist in bacterial cells, and they also occur in some eukaryotes. Often, the genes carried in plasmids provide bacteria with genetic advantages, such as antibiotic resistance.

This plasmid can be introduced into a bacterium by way of the process called transformation. Then, because bacteria divide rapidly, they can be used as factories to copy DNA fragments in large quantities. A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Plasmids naturally exist in bacterial cells, and they also occur in some eukaryotes. Often, the genes carried in plasmids provide bacteria with genetic advantages, such as antibiotic resistance. Plasmids have a wide range of lengths, from roughly one thousand DNA base pairs to hundreds of thousands of base pairsEukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromosomes. Chromosomes are single strands of DNA. Bacterial DNA is packaged into a single chromosome that is a continuous loop. In both cases, the DNA must be folded or coiled so that it will fit into the cell. In bacteria the compaction involves DNA binding proteins that help to form initial loops followed by coiling of DNA.DNA Replication in Bacteria. In general, DNA is replicated by uncoiling of the helix, strand separation by breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the complementary strands, and synthesis of two new strands by complementary base pairing. 7) . In bacteria, Par proteins function to separate bacterial chromosomes to opposite poles of the cell during cell division.

For example, trees are sourced to make paper, then the pulp is processed to create the paper and then the finished product is sold in stores. Economics is part of the social structure of a society and is concerned with how people produce and consume goods and services. What types of goods and services are produced and consumed in a society depend on geography and social customs. The three major economic sectors are: primary, secondary and tertiary. [for QUATERNARY ... see final paragraph, below]. The PRIMARY economic sector includes obtaining and refining raw materials such as wood, steel and coal. Primary economic sector workers include loggers, steelworkers and coalminer1 Primary: Involves the retrieval and production of raw materials, such as corn, coal, wood and iron.

This shift is called tertiarisation.Primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. There are three main types of industry in which firms operate. These sectors form a chain of production which provides customers with finished goods or services. Primary production: this involves acquiring raw materials. For example, metals and coal have to be mined, oil drilled from the ground, rubber tapped from trees, foodstuffs farmed and fish trawled. Tertiary production: this refers to the commercial services that support the production and distribution process, eg insurance, transport, advertising, warehousing and other services such as teaching and health care.

A nations economy can be divided into various sectors to define the proportion of the population engaged in the activity sector. This categorization is seen as a continuum of distance from the natural environment. The packaging and processing of the raw material associated with this sector is also considered to be part of this sector.

Let's say an average basement is 1,000 square feet of finished space. So the cost of a basement is between $10,000 and $35,000. 10k if you're doing most of the work yourself and up to $35,000 if you're hiring a contractor to finish your basement. Now.There are some options when it comes to finishing a basement, and they all come with a cost. If you choose a basic do-it-yourself makeover, including adding moisture control, framing in walls and adding decor and furnishings, your cost will run between $10,000 and $27,000.Expect this type of basement to cost more at least $65,000. A basement finishing system is another option, running $45,000 to $55,000. These out-of-the-box systems include everything from moisture-proof, insulated wall panels to ceilings to lighting.1 Adding a basement to an existing house can cost $30,000-$70,000 or more, depending on the size of the existing crawlspace or half-basement or if the house is on a slab foundation, and how much of the work is do-it-yourself and how much is done by contractors.Our free calculator uses recent, trusted data to estimate costs for your Basement Wall Framing project.

Doctors may test the baby 's bilirubin levels during that time to make sure it has not gotten worse.Definition. Infant jaundice is a yellow discoloration in a newborn baby's skin and eyes. Infant jaundice occurs because the baby's blood contains an excess of bilirubin (bil-ih-ROO-bin), a yellow-colored pigment of red blood cells.In cases where pre-hepatic jaundice has been caused by an infection, such as malaria, medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes caused by elevated levels of the chemical bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). The term jaundice is derived from the French word jaune, which means yellow.Phototherapy. Phototherapy is treatment with light. It is used in some cases of newborn jaundice to lower the bilirubin levels in your baby’s blood through a process called photo-oxidation. Oxidation is the process of adding oxygen to change a substance (in this case, the bilirubin).Jaundice is not an illness in itself, but a medical condition in which too much bilirubin -- a compound produced by the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells -- is circulating in the blood. The excess bilirubin causes the skin, eyes, and mucus membranes in the mouth to turn a yellowish color.Jaundice is a yellow discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes, and the whites of the eyes caused by increased amounts of bilirubin in the blood. Jaundice is a sign of an underlying disease process.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Even though shrimp is low in fat, many doctors tell their patients to avoid it because it's high in cholesterol. The typical serving of shrimp has two-thirds the amount of cholesterol you should consume in an entire day. Well, shrimp lovers take heart.That’s because a small serving of 3.5 ounces supplies about 200 mg of cholesterol. For people at high risk for heart disease, that amounts to a full day’s allotment. (For everyone else, 300 mg is the limit.) However, shrimp is very low in total fat (about 1.5 grams per serving) with almost no saturated fat at all.The good news: the shrimp diet also raised levels of HDL cholesterol.

If your dogs received three rounds of vaccines as puppies (around 8 weeks, 11 weeks and 16 weeks of age), they are somewhat protected until one year of age. At that time, they need boosters. Parvo is usually a juvenile disease, affecting the young and unvaccinated.Generally, the first vaccine is given at 6-8 weeks of age and a booster is given at four-week intervals until the puppy is 16-20 weeks of age, and then again at one year of age. A puppy’s vaccination program is not complete before four months of age.Vaccine is given in two doses, 2 to 4 weeks apart, in dogs older than 12 weeks of age. Revaccination is recommended annually, but only for dogs with reasonable risk of exposure.

Her mother, Caroline Lake Quiner, was educated, gentle, and proud, according to her daughter.Laura Ingalls Wilder was born on February 7, 1867, to Charles and Caroline Ingalls in their log cabin just outside of Pepin, Wisconsin.Born Laura Elizabeth Ingalls in Wisconsin in 1867, she spent her childhood as a pioneer girl,  settling in Wisconsin (twice), Missouri, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota by the time she was twelve years old.', 'corpus_39': \"1 Serotonin is created by a biochemical conversion process. 2  Serotonin is manufactured in the brain and the intestines. 3  The majority of the body's serotonin, between 80-90%, can be found in the gastrointestinal tract. 4  Serotonin that is used inside the brain must be produced within it.Although serotonin is well known as a brain neurotransmitter, it is estimated that 90 percent of the body's serotonin is made in the digestive tract. In fact, altered levels of this peripheral serotonin have been linked to diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis.Serotonin is manufactured in the brain and the intestines. The majority of the body's serotonin, between 80-90%, can be found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It can also be found in the blood platelets and the central nervous system (CNS).Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter responsible for regulating many body and brain activities. Though people associate serotonin only with the brain due to its role as a neurotransmitter, the brain only synthesizes and houses about 5 percent of the body's supply of serotonin. The small intestine produces the rest, and this serotonin never finds its way to the brain; rather, it plays other roles in the body.1 Serotonin is manufactured in the brain and the intestines. 2  The majority of the body's serotonin, between 80-90%, can be found in the gastrointestinal tract. 3  Serotonin that is used inside the brain must be produced within it.1. Seroton in acts as a ne urotransmitter, a type of chemical that helps relay signals from one area of the brain to another. Although serotonin is manufactured in the brain, where it performs its primary functions, some 90% of our serotonin supply is found in the digestive tract and in blood platelets.1 Bowel function. 2  Most of the body's serotonin is found in the gastrointestinal tract where it regulates bowel function and movements. 3  It also plays a part in reducing the appetite while consuming a meal. 4  Mood. 5  It is most well know for its role in the brain where it plays a major part in mood, anxiety and happiness.Neurons produce serotonin in the brain. The serotonin in these two areas are distinct. That is, the serotonin from the intestine cannot go to the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, which the body uses to protect the brain from toxins.\", 'corpus_40': \"Napoleon in later life considered the Civil Code to be the most significant of his achievements. The Code represented a comprehensive reformation and codification of the French civil laws.It entered into force on March 21, 1804. The Napoleonic code was the first legal code to be established in a country with a civil legal system. It was based on Roman law, and followed Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis in dividing civil law into: 1.personal status; 2.property; 3.acquisition of property.Confidence votes 13. the Napoleonic code was important because it has influenced various liberal western laws of today for example free education non beist criminal trials benefits to those who need them and so on. it is likely had napoleon have not writ his code our liberal ideas would not have been as advanced as they are today.The Napoleonic Code was a unified legal code produced in post-revolutionary France and enacted by Napoleon in 1804. Napoleon gave the laws his name, and they both largely remain in place in France today, and heavily influenced world laws in the nineteenth century.The Civil Code of the French People was enacted in 1804 across all the regions France then controlled: France, Belgium, Luxembourg, chunks of Germany and Italy, and was later spread further across Europe. In 1807 it became known as the Code Napoleon.Why was the napoleonic code so important? That Code, with its stress on clearly written  and accessible law, was a major step in replacing the previous  patchwork of feudal laws.Best Answer: The original Napoleonic Code, or Code Napoleon (napoléon originally called The code civil des, francais or civil code of The), french was The french civil, code established at the behest Of. napoleon napoléonBest Answer: The original Napoleonic Code, or Code Napoleon (napoléon originally called The code civil des, francais or civil code of The), french was The french civil, code established at the behest Of.
