The hourly wages can range from minimum wage to around $15 per hour. However, the majority of their earnings come from tips, which can vary greatly depending on the popularity of the bar and the bartender's skills. According to the context, some bartenders in high volume establishments or popular bars can make $700 to $1000 a night in tips alone. However, this can vary greatly depending on the location and the specific bar. It's important to note that the top dollar jobs in bartending typically require experience and excellent customer service skills.

       "  'A furuncle, also referred to as a boil, is a skin abscess that forms when bacteria infect a hair follicle beneath the surface of the skin. The infection causes the follicle to swell and fill with pus, resulting in a painful, red, and raised bump on the skin. The bump may begin as a small, benign-looking lesion but can later rupture and weep fluid. Furuncles are most commonly found on the face and neck, but they can also develop on other areas of the body, such as the thigh or buttocks. The symptoms of a furuncle include pain, redness, and swelling, and the bump may feel hard to the touch as the infection worsens. The cause of a furuncle is typically the infection of a hair follicle or oil gland by bacteria or fungi present on the skin surface.',\n",
       "  \"Urinalysis is a valuable diagnostic tool used to detect various disorders and abnormalities in the body. It can identify a wide range of conditions, including urinary tract infections, kidney diseases, and diabetes, among others. The test involves examining the appearance, concentration, and content of urine for physical, chemical, and microscopic abnormalities. Abnormalities detected through urinalysis may indicate the presence of diseases or illnesses, such as cloudy urine in the case of a urinary tract infection or increased protein levels, which can be a sign of kidney disease. Additionally, urinalysis may be used to diagnose cancer, specifically kidney cancer, by detecting blood in the urine. However, it's important to note that the presence of blood in the urine can also be caused by benign conditions, and further testing would be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.\",\n",
       "  'Vitamin A is a vital nutrient that plays several essential roles in the body. It is important for growth and development, and it contributes to maintaining a healthy immune system and good vision. Vitamin A can be found in foods in two principal forms: retinol and retinyl ester. Retinol is the form of vitamin A absorbed when consuming animal food sources, and it is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Retinyl ester, on the other hand, is the form found in tissues due to the instability of pure alcohol retinol.\\n\\nVitamin A has various applications in medicine. It is used for treating vitamin A deficiency and reducing complications of diseases such as malaria, HIV, measles, and diarrhea in children. Additionally, vitamin A is used to address various health conditions, including shigellosis, diseases of the nervous system, nose infections, loss',\n",
       "  \"Genetic alterations in normal cells can be caused by various factors. Some genetic mutations are inherited from parents, while others can be acquired throughout one's life due to exposure to carcinogens in the environment. Oncogenes, which are damaged versions of normal genes called proto-oncogenes, can also cause genetic alterations that promote cancer cell growth. These oncogenes can instruct a healthy cell to allow rapid growth, fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth, or tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. The initiation of cell transformation is generally associated with these genetic alterations, leading to the loss of intercellular- and/or extracellular-matrix-mediated cell adhesion and growth regulation.\",\n",

However, for a larger basement project, the cost to frame the walls would depend on the overall size of the finished basement space. For an average basement of 1,000 square feet, the cost to frame the walls would fall between $10,000 and $35,000, depending on whether the homeowner is doing most of the work themselves or hiring a contractor.',\n",

       "  \"The kidneys play a crucial role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. Proteins, including albumin, are normally absent in urine because the kidney cells have selective permeability, allowing them to prevent the excretion of large molecules like proteins. This mechanism ensures that essential proteins remain in the bloodstream to maintain various bodily functions. However, in certain kidney diseases, the kidney cells' ability to prevent the leakage of albumin into the urine is compromised, leading to albuminuria.\",\n",

       "  'But transgenic animals just have one novel gene. What about an animal with a whole new genome? Could a clone , a genetically exact copy of an organism, be developed using techniques associated with biotechnology? It could be argued that human cloning is one of the inevitable outcomes of modern biotechnology. It \"simply\" involves the removal of the nucleus from a somatic cell and its placement into an unfertilized egg cell whose nucleus has either been deactivated or removed. This new cell would mimic the zygote, the first diploid cell of a new organism. This new zygote is allowed to become established, and a few days later is placed into the uterus of a surrogate mother. Theoretically this would result in an individual genetically identical to the donor. Obviously, there are many ethical and legal issues associated with human cloning, and of course, it is not a \"simple\" procedure. But animal cloning is arguably a different story.',\n",
